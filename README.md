# How to Run the Application

To run the application, follow the steps below:

## 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine.

## 2. Open Two Terminals
The application consists of two parts: the client and the server. Therefore, you need to open two separate terminals.

### __First Terminal - Start the Client__
In the first terminal, run the following commands to navigate to the client folder, install the dependencies, and start the development server:
```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### __Second Terminal - Start the Server__
In the second terminal, run the following commands to navigate to the server folder, install the dependencies, and start the server using nodemon:
```
cd server
npm install
nodemon index.js
```
## 3. Access the Application
Once both the client and the server are running, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to the following URL:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```
